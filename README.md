# Report_GUI
Example of GUI creation using Java Swing library and other related components

The coding for this was done without use of a GUI builder as I wanted to get a feel for coding GUIs by hand.
The PDFs generated by this application are 10% of the size of Word generated PDFs. 
Although the formatting is superior with the Word PDFs, the functionality is the same and therefore the 
additional formatting may not be necessary.

In future, I would like to expand the capabilities of this GUI application in a number of ways including:
- Dynamic field creation
- Dynamic sub-levels
- Use of Java data structures, such as a hash table and SparseMatrix, for storing data based on the set's composition
